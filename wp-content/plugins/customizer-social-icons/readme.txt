Easily change and modify dozens of Social Media networks the native way - in the WordPress Customizer!

== Description ==

Customizer Social Icons aims to bring one of the most implemented features across websites into your WordPress Customizer.  It helps to bridge the gap of not having a native Social Media Icon tool available in WordPress directly, and gives you the features you need without the overhead of a clunky non-native interface.

You can control the style of icon, colors, size, and spacing of your icons to fit your website's needs hassle free inside of the WordPress Customizer.  Any of your social media network urls found in your menus will automatically be transformed into the corresponding social media icons for you.

Available Social Media Icons:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Google+
* Bitbucket
* Snapchat
* Gratipay

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: I don't get it.  What do I do? =

**A**: Don't worry!  Customizing a site for a new and even experienced user can get complicated and be frustrating.  This plugin utilizes the native WordPress menus system to transform your social media links into social media icons.  To get there follow these steps:

1. Click on "Customize" to get to the WordPress Customizer.
2. Click on the tab that says "Menus".
3. Next, click on "Menu Locations," and you will see a new panel slide in that will display all of your theme's available menu locations.  The menu locations are locations your theme has designated as being locations you can stick a menu inside.  These will be the locations you can add Social Media Icons to with this plugin.
4. Click on "Edit Menu" if you have a menu assigned to a location, or select a menu from the dropdown to add icons to that.
5. Press "Add Items," and a panel will slide out with some options of things you can add.
6. Select the tab that says "Social Media Icons."
7. Choose the social media icon that you want to add to your menu.
8. The item is added to your menu, and will have the URL filled out with the social network's website as a placeholder to add your username into.
9. Now you that you've added some social icons to your menu, you can modify the appearance of the icons in the "Social Icons" section in the customizer!

= Q: Can I add/remove social media icons for social network x, y, z? =

**A**: Yes! This plugin has a configuration filter, so you can just inspect the 'networks' array for how to prepare the data and filter to suit your needs!

= Q: How can I add this to my own theme and set defaults? =

**A**: We recommend using the built in configuration filter for this plugin to make any modifications to how you want your theme to handle social media icons.  You are able to override the default size, display of text with the icon, and set the icon style to one of the five built in types.
